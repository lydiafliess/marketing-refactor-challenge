# marketing-refactor-challenge

## Description

- Horiseon was looking to make their website accessible and optimize it for search engines
- I refactored their code to add descriptions for the images, icons, and semantic elements so that it could be understood by those that use, for example, screenreaders.
I also removed some repetitive code within the style.css file to clean it up.
- These changes make the code easier to read and navigate. These changes also bring the website up to accessibility standards.
- Througout this project I learned why it is so important to use DRY (Do Not Repeat Youself) code, relevant descriptions, and semantic elements.
